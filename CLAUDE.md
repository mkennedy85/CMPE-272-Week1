# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a CMPE-272 coursework directory containing three main assignments focused on cloud computing and containerization:

1. **Serverless Platform Comparison**: Analysis of AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure serverless offerings with product management recommendations
2. **Docker Development Pipeline**: Building Docker images from source code, running tests in containers, and pushing to registries  
3. **VM vs Container Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive performance comparison between applications running in VMs (Vagrant) vs containers (Docker)

## Project Structure

This appears to be an assignment workspace rather than a traditional codebase. The README.md contains the assignment requirements and instructions for:

- Serverless platform deep-dive and feature proposals
- Docker containerization workflow implementation
- Performance benchmarking between VMs and containers using tools like Vagrant and Docker
- Metrics collection for startup time, memory usage, CPU utilization, request throughput, and response times

## Development Approach

When working on these assignments, focus on:

- **Assignment 1**: Research and analysis work with data-driven arguments for serverless platform features
- **Assignment 2**: Hands-on Docker implementation including Dockerfile creation, testing pipelines, and registry operations
- **Assignment 3**: Setting up both Vagrant VMs and Docker containers for the same application, then conducting systematic performance comparisons with proper benchmarking methodology

## Key Deliverables

Each assignment requires documentation with screenshots and detailed analysis. This is academic coursework requiring reports rather than production code deployment.
